# Binary Search Algorithm -- Guessing Game

"""
    guessinggame()
Use the Binary Search Algorithm to guess a user's whole
number between 1 and 100 based on the user's feedback.

After the guess is displayed, the user enters l, h or c
for lower, higher or correct.

Repeat this process until the correct number is guessed.
